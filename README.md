This project is about CFA/ Trading nomenclature & calculators used. 
# Motivation

My background is futures trading namely arbitraging 3 month Euribor futures via spreads, butterflies, combo's & condors  across the calender quarters. 

This style of trading serves as a proxy for borrowing/lending in the cash markets & taking advantage of movements in the yield curve.

There's also calculators for equities 


# Tech/framework used

Python & its respective libraries, Flask, React & of course the ever lovable Ruby.
